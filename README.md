# Prolog.

>#### Is a predicate logic-based programming language, developed in the 1970s. It allows the declaration of facts and rules to define relationships between objects, using inference and unification to answer queries. With natural support for recursion and backtracking, it is widely applied in artificial intelligence systems, natural language processing, and expert systems.

### Card Game, Uno.

>#### Uno is a popular card game played with a specially printed deck. Players aim to be the first to empty their hand by matching the color or number of the top card in the discard pile. Special action cards like "Reverse," "Skip," and "Wild" add strategic depth and unpredictability. Players can challenge each other with penalty cards for failure to declare "Uno" when they have one card left. Uno is easy to learn, encourages interaction, and is enjoyed by players of all ages worldwide.
